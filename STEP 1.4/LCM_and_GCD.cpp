Input:
A = 5 , B = 10
Output:
10 5
Explanation:
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while
thier GCD is 5.

Input:
A = 14 , B = 8
Output:
56 2
Explanation:
LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while
thier GCD is 2.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function lcmAndGcd() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a List of two Integers, the required LCM and GCD.
> Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B))
> Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

<Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
The algorithm is based on below facts.

>1. If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
>2. Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
